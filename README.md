Source codes for Label Propagation
 ---
 
Label propagation (LP) is a graph-based algorithm for multi-label classification. I upload the program I have implemented for my study. 
I have implemented the following some algorithms.
1. __Label Propagation (LP)__
2. __Dynamic Label Propagation (DLP)__
3. __Label Propagation Through Linear Neighborhoods (LNP)__
  
Libraries Used
---
- Python
  1. [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
  2. [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
